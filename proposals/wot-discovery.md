## Abstract

W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Descriptions (TD) provide metadata that
describe the affordances and semantics of IoT devices and services.
However, before a TD can be interpreted and used, it needs to be found.
This document describes a discovery process for WoT TDs that also 
provides appropriate security and privacy access controls, supports 
multiple "first contact" mechanisms, supports advanced querying
capabilities, and supports both local and global discovery use cases.
This discovery process is based on CoRE Resource Directory {{CoRE-RD}}
with authentication following ACE {{ACE}} and can be accessed over either
CoAP {{CoAP}} or HTTP {{HTTP1.1}}.  To preserve privacy, the system
separates the discovery process into two stages, open
introduction protocols for first contact and a directory service that
provides querying capabilities and access to metadata, but only after
authentication and authorization.  Any introduction mechanism may be
used that can provide the address of a directory service but we will
specify several useful ones.  

# Introduction

This MAY {{?RFC2119}} be useful.
