# January Princeton Testfest

Held 28.01-03.02, 2019 at Siemens Corporate Technology, 755 College Road East, Princeton, NJ, USA, 08540.

You can participate to the Testfest by choosing one (or more) of the following roles:

* [Implementation Owner](#implementation-owner) : You have a WoT consumer or producer implementation. What counts as an implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/master/testing/criteria.md).
* [Tester](#tester): You have tools that can be used for testing a consumer or a producer implementation.
* [Observer](#observer): You do not have any specific tools but at least have a browser.

## Implementation Owner

### Consumer Implementer

Needs more thinking. Logging the consumed TDs?

### Producer Implementer

You should produce TDs that can cover the whole spec and submit to a repository that has a folder in your name.

## Tester

Playground

Assertion tester

Test bench

## Observer

Use Playground at least.

## Tools

* Simulated device based on TD from Ege: https://www.npmjs.com/package/virtual-thing
