<h3>Panasonic Corporation</h3>
<p>
Panasonic supports this specification as it enables device manufacturers
to describe features and functionality of multiple devices in a uniform way.
This will make it possible to build mash-up applications easily with multiple devices
not only from single vendor but also from different vendors, which will expand the ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
Panasonic already has various IoT devices in the market and this specification is the
first candidate to be used for the directory system to discover those devices.
At the moment,
Panasonic implements two types of clients (TD consumer) as well as two types of servers (TD producer),
together with independent authentication server as a shared component, for experimental purposes.
</p>

<h4 id="impl-panasonic-server-real">WoT Server for Real Devices: TD Producer</h4>
<p>This implementation is a TD producer which is hosted on a cloud server and
connected to real things in the lab through a proprietary tunneling mechanism alike to remote and local WoT proxy.
This implementation accepts HTTP bindings with bearer token authorization issued by the
Panasonic Authentication Server explained above.
This implementation currently provides the following things:
<ol>
<li>Two Home Air Conditioners,</li>
<li>One robotics cleaner,</li>
<li>One set of Philips Hue Lighting and</li>
<li>Three LED bulletin boards.</li>
</ol>
This implementation is based on Apache HTTP server with plugins written in PHP. </p>
