<h1 class="no_toc" id="background">Introduction</h1>

<p> Interoperability of devices and services for the Internet of Things with cloud platforms and services at a worldwide scale is a huge challenge.

<p>Recent developments in electronics have dramatically reduced the cost
for devices functioning as tags, sensors and actuators for the physical
environment, i.e. the Internet of Things (IoT).
The market potential for IoT devices and services is currently held back by fragmentation due to a plethora of communication technologies and the lack
of a common approach to enabling services.</p>

<p>RESTful Web technologies have become very important in recent years, such as JavaScript+JSON combined with open standards for data formats, interface definitions and access control.</p>

The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> activities is to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things by introducing a Web-based abstraction layer capable of interconnecting existing Internet of Things platforms, devices and cloud services and complementing available standards.
Baseline specifications have been developed by the Web of Things groups during the last two years to address an architecture and a common format for describing devices and services.

<p><a href="iot.png"><img src="iot.png" alt="TODO: TODO: Create a current picture of Web of Things domains" id="wot-domains" /></a></p>

<p id="use-cases">There is a very wide range of application domains, and
the following is just a sample:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smart Home</li>
<li>Security for homes, businesses and public settings</li>
<li>Smart Cities</li>
<li>Environmental monitoring</li>
<li>Healthcare at home and in hospitals</li>
<li>Manufacturing, construction and retail</li>
<li>Transportation: cars, buses, metro, trains</li>
<li>Utilities: electricity, water, gas, drainage</li>
<li>Energy efficiency, smart appliances and the smart grid</li>
<li>Managing emergencies: floods, fires, earthquakes and civil disturbances</li>
</ul>

To achieve the goal for cross-platform interoperability, 
	the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">W3C Web of Things Working Group</a> 
	has finalized a first set of standardized building blocks.
They are based upon rich metadata that describes the data and interaction models exposed to applications, 
	and the communications and security requirements for platforms to communicate effectively.

During the course of the Web of Things standardisation activities,
the following specifications were created:
	
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a></li> 
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> 
	with its <i>Properties, Actions, Events<i> interaction model.</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-wot-scripting-api-20181129/">WoT Scripting API</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/NOTE-wot-binding-templates-20180405/">WoT Binding Templates"</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/NOTE-wot-security-20181203/">Security and Privacy Considerations</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>A W3C Workshop is now planned for early 2019 to examine the potential for further development of these open standards as a basis for interoperable services between devices, at the network edge, or in the cloud.
It will discuss reducing of ftagmentation through the use of common device abstractions, web protocols and scripting languages for exposing and consuming services across specific IoT technologies to enable new use cases, such as a common monitoring and control of assets from multiple vendors for building a digital twin of a group of physical devices.</p>
